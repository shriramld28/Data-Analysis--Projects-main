2. McDonald's Menu Nutritional Analysis
Tools Used: Python - Data Preprocessing · Exploratory Data Analysis · Data Visualization · Category Insights · Project Documentation

Description: Extracted meaningful information from the McDonald's menu nutritional dataset. Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the nutritional distribution and trends.
Created visualizations to present the calorie count and nutrition facts of different menu items. Identified healthy and less healthy menu options based on nutritional content.

3. Data Analysis using SQL - Realtime NFT Database
Tools Used: MySQL - Database Management System (DBMS) · Joins · Histograms
Description: To understand the analytics for better decisions, series of tasks were performed.
Solved tasks such as: \

Number of sales occurred. \
Returned the top 5 most expensive transactions (by USD price) for this data set. \
Returned a table with a row for each transaction with an event column, a USD price column, and a moving average of USD price that averages the last 50 transactions. \
Return all the NFT names and their average sale price in USD. Sort descending. Name the average column as average_price. \
Return each day of the week and the number of sales that occurred on that day of the week, as well as the average price in ETH. Order by the count of transactions in ascending order.
